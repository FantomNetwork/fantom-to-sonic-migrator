We are excited to announce the launch of the Sonic mainnet — a high-throughput, EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain platform that offers developers attractive incentives and powerful infrastructure.

FTM holders can now upgrade their tokens to S on Sonic on a 1:1 basis using our migration contract and gain access to all Sonic applications.

## Upgrade FTM to S

FTM holders can now seamlessly upgrade their tokens to S on a 1:1 basis using the migration contract. Here’s how it works:

1. To perform the migration, send your old FRM tokens to the migration smart contract address `0xba0343b38145933C6341a88427024abC67c428f8`
2. For the amount, choose to **send entire balance** of your FTM tokens. The migration contract will wait for the full balance to arrive before initiating the migration process.
3. In just a few moments, your S will arrive on **Sonic**, and you’ll be ready to explore everything the ecosystem has to offer!

If you're holding FTM on Ethereum or a CEX? Use the **same migration address**. All wallets support the migration process.

Your wallet will automatically recognize the new S tokens, which will be credited to your wallet. This is made possible by the wallet linkage functionality in the migration contract, which leverages standard private key cryptography.

Congratulations, you have **successfully completed the migration**. Now you can be sure that you hold Sonic tokens.
